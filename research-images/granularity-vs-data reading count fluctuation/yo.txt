As the total size of the dimensional space you are projecting the 
data readings into diminishes, e.g. Regions gets smaller, the fluctuation
in number of data readings per cycle tends to increase. This is likely
due to a combinatorial effect where each small space that has been 
projected into a single pixel has it's own fluctuation, and once you 
start combining multiple small fluctuations into a single pixel that 
pixel has unpredictable and potentially very large fluctuation between
time cycles. This result can be generalized, and therefore we can claim
that the best projection will be the one with the smallest granularity 
in terms of available projection space e.g. if you can map every 1x1 meter
square into a unique location, then you will likely be able to achieve 
better k-anonymity results than if you can only map every 10x10 meter
square into a unique location. 

This may not hold true for some locations or some time slices...
