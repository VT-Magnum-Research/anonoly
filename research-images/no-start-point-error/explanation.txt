we see the two regions, wth the large attempting to consume all but 3 pixels 
of the smaller. THe problem is that none of the pixels that are neighboring
the two regions (on the smaller polygon) are consumable. I see two
solutions:
 - consume the entire region. You clearly didn't want all of it (or get
 	start point would never be called), but this ensure k-anon is retained
 - 'flip' the consumption, and force the smaller to 'consume' x number of 
 	pixels from the larger
