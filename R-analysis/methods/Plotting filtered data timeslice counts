# These gaps are due to the bin construction method - we are not contructing bins 
# for *all* 15 minute intervals, and not just for the intervals that exist between
# 12pm and 6pm. The data has already been filtered to 12-6, so *most* of the bins
# are empty. 
# Let's only construct bins for 12pm-6pm next...

# We notice that again we have small gaps in the plot. Examining the data, we see
# that these gaps are due to the way a histogram is plotted - every bin gets a 
# column, and therefore there is a bin for the time between 6pm of one day, and 
# 12pm the next day that has no entries (due to our prior filtering of the data)

# The fix is fairly simple: Just remove all entries for 6pm exactly, and let the bin
# stretch from 5:45pm of one day to 12pm of the next day. Because there are zero 
# readings from 6pm-12pm, this equals the counts from 5:45-6pm but looks cleaner

# Each bin is a column, so the 'larger' bins that mark the end of the day are 
# a few pixels wider than their 15-minute increment counterparts
